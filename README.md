# Quizlet React App

A quick quiz app built using a trivia API and React. This is 4th solo project from the Scrimba React course. Scrimba provides a Figma design, but the code is all me!

# Things I Learned
- How to set up simple routing with React Router Dom
- How to use CSS to position images partially offscreen
- How to use Axios to fetch data from an API
- How to use nanoid to create unique keys for each child
- Better understanding/practice of how to break up tasks to tackle problems on a smaller scale.
- How to lift state
- How important it is to fully understand the structure of your app, the state(s) needed and how everything will interact BEFORE you start coding. Lest ye risk days of redoing your app in maximum frustration.
